From the ancient tribes dancing to the rhythmic tunes of nature to the modern-day melody enthusiast tapping their feet to a well-orchestrated symphony, the power of music has always been undeniable. Songs have the uncanny ability to get lodged in our heads, making us move and altering our emotions. What is it that makes music so powerful and influential? To answer this, let's think of music as a programming language - not for computers, but for the human mind. <br><br>

<b>Decoding the Melody: Understanding the Language of Music</b>

But what happens when we blur the boundaries and consider the energy associated with our computations? From a Wi-Fi router to a gargantuan powerplant, all involve a degree of computation, but the energy they consume varies wildly. With increasing interest in low-power, green devices, it's intriguing to consider the flip side of the equation. This brings us to the revolutionary concept of "bits with bite" where computer chips are not just measured in volts, but in megavolts and gigavolts.
