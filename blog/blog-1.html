In this biblical narrative, a unified humanity once spoke a common language, fostering unparalleled cooperation and innovation. As humanity sought to challenge the divine, constructing a tower reaching for the heavens, God, in response to their hubris, confounded their language, thereby dispersing them across the globe. From this tale was born our world's linguistic diversity, creating both a fascinating richness and a barrier to global understanding. Today, we stand on the brink o <a href = 'blog0.html'>...Read More</a></p>

The most recent leap in AI technology comes from the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the most advanced of which are currently pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the world. These high-powered, versatile models are now equipped to reveal to humanity truths we have been unable to perceive up until now.<br><br>

AI's ability to process vast quantities of information is already well established. The models can swiftly and accurately sift through data that would take humans centuries <a href = 'blog1.html'>...Read More</a></p>

As we continue to advance in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) is starting to take shape. AGI, often imagined as an entity capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge at a level indistinguishable from human intellect, represents the next level of AI advancement. But there's another way to view the development of AGI — one that takes inspiration from the interlinked ecosystems of our very own planet. Let's explore the idea of AGI as an Artificial Gaia  <a href = 'blog2.html'>...Read More</a></p>

The tale weaves a vibrant tapestry of language, culture, and cognition, underpinned by a curious concept – the deadly 'Snow Crash' virus, capable of crashing both computers and human minds. It poses an intriguing question: Could information, in certain forms, pose a threat to our wellbeing or even our lives?

To explore this idea, we'll need to dip our toes into the science behind our perception of reality and delve into the realm of information hazards, also known as 'infoha <a href = 'blog3.html'>...Read More</a></p>
