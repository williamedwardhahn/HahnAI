From the ancient tribes dancing to the rhythmic tunes of nature to the modern-day melody enthusiast tapping their feet to a well-orchestrated symphony, the power of music has always been undeniable. Songs have the uncanny ability to get lodged in our heads, making us move and altering our emotions. What is it that makes music so powerful and influential? To answer this, let's think of music as a programming language - not for computers, but for the human mind. <br><br>

<b>Decoding the Melody: Understanding the Language of Music</b>
