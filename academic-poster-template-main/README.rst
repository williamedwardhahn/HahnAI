 A template for (more) accessible posters, using HTML+CSS
==========================================================

Modern HTML+CSS is more than enough for most academic posters:

- No more fighting with LaTeX+Beamer or PowerPoint/LibreOffice.
- It works on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Readers can adjust the font size trivially.
- It's much more accessible than PDFs.
